- Ever had a side project that you haven't been working on for a long time?
- There is a project that I started in 2021 mainly to work on my homework assignments for math.
- It is a more complex web calculator
- A few days ago I decided to stop upgrading all the dependencies
- I thought that it would be helpful to some people who are facing the same problem to follow my train of thought.

## How was the codebase? (working title)

- To make it short: It is a mess
- In 2021 I wanted to learn sth new in web development. At this time svelte kit was in the public beta so I gave it a shot.
- Was a pretty great experience back then working with it.
- But over the years I stopped working on this project because I decided to don't do my homework.
- Therefore, there was no real progress within the project
- It is all old beta framework code.

## How difficult would it be to upgrade the project to the latest versions? (working title)

- First of all I would need to resolve the dependency mess. There are many old npm packages used that are nowadays no longer supported or no longer needed.
- After upgrading to the latest releases I would have to migrate almost all of my code. 
- Today there are a lot of best practises that should be used to write clean and good svelte kit code. 
- But to do so in the future I might have to start almost from the beginning which would take a lot of time.
- Furthermore, I am not really sure how static exports to html are working today. So I would have to read the documentation carefully to understand all these new principles. 

## What were the influencing factors? (working title)

- Well there were many factors that influenced how I decided in the first place.
- The effort required to migrate the whole app to the latest dependencies
- The security risk of not upgrading everything
- There are no users.
- I wanted to learn how svelte kit works nowadays
- It personally somehow triggered me to not upgrade the codebase
- I loved the beauty of this old legacy code I wrote almost 4 years ago

## What was my final decision and why?

- The total required effort, the low amount of users and the low security risk were factors that heavily stated that I should not upgrade the dependencies.
- But the personal influence factors like learning new svelte and the trigering factor of an project of mine not being upgraded on purpose also had an heavy impact.
- Finally, yes I somehow liked the code I was watching at and working with.
- So I decided to act rationally and not emotionally and dropped dependency upgrades for this project.

## What can you learn from all this?

- These personal decisions are very hard for everyone.
- In the end you have to evaluate all the factors for yourself. If the project has a high emotional value for you, keep working on it
- But if you can't find a proper decision you will need to decide damn rationally. Sure, this might feel bad in the first place. But in the end it is the right decision. Like in my case. I really loved this project, because it was one of my first web projects I worked on longer than 2 months. But even if this project had such an high emotional value to me, it was right to not upgrade the dependencies anymore. It wouldn't be worth the effort. And I still can work on it. But only with beta status dependencies. 
- So in the end the rational decision might be also the decision that is emotionally the best for you. It's a win for both.
