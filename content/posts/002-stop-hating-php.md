I am working now with PHP for about three years in an professional environment. But PHP seems to be still one of the most hated languages among developers, which is I cannot understand, 
because PHP has evolved to be a pretty decent language.

## Why is it hated so much?

- Was insecure in the early days
- Too many configuration options
- OOP was added in PHP5 which was too late.
- Furthermore, important features also came way too late. Composer in 2016, but maven already in 2004
- Also the syntax is not liked by many people. Things like streams are way better implemented in Java or Javascript than they are in PHP. (Give example of data transformation)
- Inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Errors are still existing from the procedural only time of PHP. But since PHP is a mixture of procedural programming and OOP now, there is inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Give example of json_decode. Errors are getting less: Show backwards compatibility thing.
- There are no good and popular open source projects with a clean codebase. They are often stuck between procedural and OOP. Give example of wordpress.

## Is it better today?

## Ecosystem

## PHP developers drive Lambo

## Conclusion
