I am working now with PHP for about three years in an professional environment. But PHP seems to be still one of the most hated languages among developers, which is I cannot understand, 
because PHP has evolved to be a pretty decent language.

## Why is it hated so much?

- Was insecure in the early days
- Too many configuration options
- OOP was added in PHP5 which was too late.
- Furthermore, the standard library namespace has bad organisation
- Furthermore, important features also came way too late. Composer in 2016, but maven already in 2004
- Also the syntax is not liked by many people. Things like streams are way better implemented in Java or Javascript than they are in PHP. (Give example of data transformation)
- Inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Errors are still existing from the procedural only time of PHP. But since PHP is a mixture of procedural programming and OOP now, there is inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Give example of json_decode.
- There are no good and popular open source projects with a clean codebase. They are often stuck between procedural and OOP. Give example of wordpress.

## Is it better today?

- Some of the popular projects like TYPO3 are migrating to frameworks that have a much cleaner codebase
- Since PHP 8 there are also modern features like enums and the language in general is much more fun to work with
- Also the language is way more secure now
- But there are still many configuration options like (error enabled or not)
- Composer has a lot of useful packages now
- The syntax is bad, but in my opinion it is not that bad, if you know how to write clean code with it (give example)
- There are still errors in the core of the language, but partially php is moving to exceptions. You might like it or not. This is your personal opinion.
- There is also a wide range of language tools today that help to improve your code.
- You have to differentiate between projects that are completely new started and legacy projects like wordpress that are still not that well. I gave the example of TYPO3 before. Typo3 got the turn and switched to a much cleaner codebase. So developing TYPO3 extensions is way more fun, than developing wordpress plugins.

## Ecosystem

- The PHP ecosystem is the reason why I actually like PHP a lot. 
- Frameworks like Symfony or Laravel are well integrated and actually pretty fun to use. 
- Almost anything you want can be done using them as long as it is web development. 
- There is also support for integrating front-end frameworks like React, Vue and so on. 
- I have been working for about 3 years professionally now in the Symfony environment and I never had a scenario where the framework itself or a third party library couldn't get the job done. 

## PHP developers drive Lambo (maybe remove)

- There are often people joking that all PHP developers drive a Lambo.
- Well as you might imagine, this is far from the truth, but the core intentions of these jokes is, 
that PHP was the choice of many startups in the early days. Facebook for example initially used PHP.
- PHP is popular as a language with that you can just get the job done. You do not have to worry about memory allocation, etc.
- Therefore, it is not as fast as other modern programming languages, but it serves it's purpose. You can get the job done efficiently and effectively. But you might not drive a Lambo.

## Conclusion

- Overall you can say, PHP was a pretty bad language in the early days and was it even in the 2010s.
- But today PHP is a pretty solid choice for your web projects. PHP itself got many modern features and is still evolving to get better over time.
- With composer as a package manager and a well integrated ecosystem of all the frameworks out there, PHP is definetly a good choice for modern web development. 

I would recommend you to just give it a shot and try it out yourself. You will love it.
