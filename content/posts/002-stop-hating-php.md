I am working now with PHP for about three years in an professional environment. But PHP seems to be still one of the most hated languages among developers, which is I cannot understand, 
because PHP has evolved to be a pretty decent language.

## Why is it hated so much?

- Was insecure in the early days
- Too many configuration options
- OOP was added in PHP5 which was too late.
- Furthermore, the standard library namespace has bad organisation
- Furthermore, important features also came way too late. Composer in 2016, but maven already in 2004
- Also the syntax is not liked by many people. Things like streams are way better implemented in Java or Javascript than they are in PHP. (Give example of data transformation)
- Inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Errors are still existing from the procedural only time of PHP. But since PHP is a mixture of procedural programming and OOP now, there is inconsistency between errors and exceptions. Give example of json_decode.
- There are no good and popular open source projects with a clean codebase. They are often stuck between procedural and OOP. Give example of wordpress.

## Is it better today?

- Some of the popular projects like TYPO3 are migrating to frameworks that have a much cleaner codebase
- Since PHP 8 there are also modern features like enums and the language in general is much more fun to work with
- Also the language is way more secure now
- But there are still many configuration options like (error enabled or not)
- Composer has a lot of useful packages now
- The syntax is bad, but in my opinion it is not that bad, if you know how to write clean code with it (give example)
- There are still errors in the core of the language, but partially php is moving to exceptions. You might like it or not. This is your personal opinion.
- There is also a wide range of language tools today that help to improve your code.
- You have to differentiate between projects that are completely new started and legacy projects like wordpress that are still not that well. I gave the example of TYPO3 before. Typo3 got the turn and switched to a much cleaner codebase. So developing TYPO3 extensions is way more fun, than developing wordpress plugins.
