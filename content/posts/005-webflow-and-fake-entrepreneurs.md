- I am currently pretty active on social media
- More and more often I see who talk about how they opened a webflow agency or building the next big SaaS
- And in most cases this seems fine to me. But lately it is starting to trigger me
- More and more people are trying to sell their services online and do marketing in social media. 
- But many of those people do not really offer you a good deal or just lie straight into your face. 
- Lets first talk about all the one man web design agencies out there

## A bit of background information

- Building a website isn't just about CMS systems and templates. It's about creating a whole corporate identity for the people.
- Let me break down the whole process for you with an simple example: 
- If you get a request to build a website for a customer, you first need to find out what the needs of the customer are.
- After that you determine the main purpose of the website. A website always needs a purpose. Even if it is just to increase your online sales or conversion rates. Your website needs to have a purpose and you have to talk with the customer about this, because this purpose is what you build the website around.
- After you got all these information you need to put in some project management. Cost definitions, goals, stakeholders of the project. All these things need to be defined to make the framework conditions crystal clear. 
- After all the organisational stuff is done, your project can finally start.
- Now you have to do some screen designs. What pages does the website need? Where to put the content? What content do we want? What type of colors should we use? What style should the website be? Modern? Retro? Minimalistic? All this should serve the main purpose of the website that you have defined before. 
- And no, a fuckin wordpress template don't fulfill your needs. Sure, it can be fine if the budget is tight or it perfectly matches your needs or you just want to build your first online appearance. Then it's totally fine.
- But generally a template is pretty generalized. In most cases it won't serve your websites purpose well enough. And another bad side effect is, that most websites then look pretty similar. 
- I would recommend you to take bootstrap as a starting point and then modify the components or build your own. It gives you a good starting point in terms of grid layouts you can use. But always try to move away from the default bootstrap look and create what fits best the general theme of the website.
- And even after the website content and layout is done, you still have many things to do. 
- Nowadays search engine optimization is important. You should think about this topic even before building your layout in the best case. But at least try to optimize some of your content afterwards. 
- When it comes to buying the domain, this should be done by the customer, because the customer should be the legal owner of the domain. Not you. You should not lock-in the user into your agency ecosystem. This would be very unprofessional. If your services are great, the customer will work with you again. No need to lock him in.
- Last but not least you will have to do some legal work. Impress and pricavy notice is very important and you should not under estimate this. ChatGPT won't do this for you. Services like e-recht24.de can do the job, but there are also cases, where it does not. In those cases you will need a person who is proficient in this topic to ensure the website you are building is clean from a legal view.
- And no, it is not enough to just add the cookies you are using to your privacy notice and install a free cookie banner plugin. You need to make sure, that there is actually no external content loaded before the user of the website accepts the cookies. And if he does not accept some cookies, these cookies are not allowed to be used. And there are also legal restrictions about how your cookie banner is allowed to look. So just installing a plugin for that won't do the job. 
- Here in Germany there are three laws you have to know. The GDPR (DSGVO), the BDSG and the BFSG. Study them and get in touch with them. You need to know the restrictions of what you are building. And those laws are restrictions you will have to know at the start of your project.

- When it comes to developing software individually for your customers there are many more restrictions. For example, You need to ensure, that the software always aligns with the latest security standards. 
- You need some professional experience or at least a few years of hobby experience to do so. I had no experience in my early days of programming and I`ve build some pretty bad applications for other people. Thank god, they do not run in production anymore! Those apps were completely insecure, had a bad architecture and were a mess to work with when it comes to modifications. 
- So make sure when you build some applications that run in production and that your customer is using that you know exactly what you are doing. And no, not ChatGPT should know what your code is doing, you should know. You should know about architecture, about software design patterns, security standards, databases, etc. 
- If you just finished university and the only programming experience you had is the Java class you had to take its not enough. 
- Do some personal projects. Get in touch with those things and learn. And no, one simple web calculator is not enough. 
- Learn how to properly build complex software before you actually start building complex software. Otherwise your customer will get shit and you will need to refactor your mess afterwards which is a total pain in the ass.
