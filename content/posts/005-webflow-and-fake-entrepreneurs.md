- I am currently pretty active on social media
- More and more often I see who talk about how they opened a webflow agency or building the next big SaaS
- And in most cases this seems fine to me. But lately it is starting to trigger me
- More and more people are trying to sell their services online and do marketing in social media. 
- But many of those people do not really offer you a good deal or just lie straight into your face. 
- Lets first talk about all the one man web design agencies out there

## A bit of background information

- Building a website isn't just about CMS systems and templates. It's about creating a whole corporate identity for the people.
- Let me break down the whole process for you with an simple example: 
- If you get a request to build a website for a customer, you first need to find out what the needs of the customer are.
- After that you determine the main purpose of the website. A website always needs a purpose. Even if it is just to increase your online sales or conversion rates. Your website needs to have a purpose and you have to talk with the customer about this, because this purpose is what you build the website around.
- After you got all these information you need to put in some project management. Cost definitions, goals, stakeholders of the project. All these things need to be defined to make the framework conditions crystal clear. 
- After all the organisational stuff is done, your project can finally start.
- Now you have to do some screen designs. What pages does the website need? Where to put the content? What content do we want? What type of colors should we use? What style should the website be? Modern? Retro? Minimalistic? All this should serve the main purpose of the website that you have defined before. 
- And no, a fuckin wordpress template don't fulfill your needs. Sure, it can be fine if the budget is tight or it perfectly matches your needs or you just want to build your first online appearance. Then it's totally fine.
- But generally a template is pretty generalized. In most cases it won't serve your websites purpose well enough. And another bad side effect is, that most websites then look pretty similar. 
- I would recommend you to take bootstrap as a starting point and then modify the components or build your own. It gives you a good starting point in terms of grid layouts you can use. But always try to move away from the default bootstrap look and create what fits best the general theme of the website.
- Furthermore, you should probably choose a CMS or page building system that allows to write your own extensions and plugins and is self hostable and open source in the best case. Vendor lock-in has the risk of rising costs or changing conditions that you cannot control. This is bad for either you, your customer or for both. If you are using a self hosted system this gives you full control over what you are doing. So use a CMS like Wordpress or Typo3. But sure, there might be also some usecases for tools like Webflow. But I will talk about that later.
- And even after the website content and layout is done, you still have many things to do. 
- Nowadays search engine optimization is important. You should think about this topic even before building your layout in the best case. But at least try to optimize some of your content afterwards. 
- When it comes to buying the domain, this should be done by the customer, because the customer should be the legal owner of the domain. Not you. You should not lock-in the user into your agency ecosystem. This would be very unprofessional. If your services are great, the customer will work with you again. No need to lock him in.
- Last but not least you will have to do some legal work. Impress and pricavy notice is very important and you should not under estimate this. ChatGPT won't do this for you. Services like e-recht24.de can do the job, but there are also cases, where it does not. In those cases you will need a person who is proficient in this topic to ensure the website you are building is clean from a legal view.
- And no, it is not enough to just add the cookies you are using to your privacy notice and install a free cookie banner plugin. You need to make sure, that there is actually no external content loaded before the user of the website accepts the cookies. And if he does not accept some cookies, these cookies are not allowed to be used. And there are also legal restrictions about how your cookie banner is allowed to look. So just installing a plugin for that won't do the job. 
- Here in Germany there are three laws you have to know. The GDPR (DSGVO), the BDSG and the BFSG. Study them and get in touch with them. You need to know the restrictions of what you are building. And those laws are restrictions you will have to know at the start of your project.

- When it comes to developing software individually for your customers there are many more restrictions. For example, You need to ensure, that the software always aligns with the latest security standards. 
- You need some professional experience or at least a few years of hobby experience to do so. I had no experience in my early days of programming and I`ve build some pretty bad applications for other people. Thank god, they do not run in production anymore! Those apps were completely insecure, had a bad architecture and were a mess to work with when it comes to modifications. 
- So make sure when you build some applications that run in production and that your customer is using that you know exactly what you are doing. And no, not ChatGPT should know what your code is doing, you should know. You should know about architecture, about software design patterns, security standards, databases, etc. 
- If you just finished university and the only programming experience you had is the Java class you had to take its not enough. 
- Do some personal projects. Get in touch with those things and learn. And no, one simple web calculator is not enough. 
- Learn how to properly build complex software before you actually start building complex software. Otherwise your customer will get shit and you will need to refactor your mess afterwards which is a total pain in the ass.


## So what are the people doing that triggers me

- Well I digged deep into these communities to find out what they are doing. I wanted tons of videos, read many tweets and even got invited to some discord servers.
- Well the most frustrating thing is that some people lie directly into your face. Its not something new that people on the internet lie all the time, but those people lie to attract new customers. 
- Let me give you an example: I won't give any names, but what you need to know is, that here in Germany there is a special corporate legal form called "UG". You can start it with 1€ capital, but with the limitation that you have to save 25% of your revenue to build your capital up to 25.000€. Then your UG is converted into an GmbH. 
- Why do you need to know this? Well there is a person out there that got lately a lot of attention on social media for posing with his cars. He said that he is running multiple startups and his most successful company is a software development agency that he runs since 2017, which made him a millionare through earnings. Fun fact, if you look up this company on north data, it is still a UG and got registered in 2021. So this company did not started in 2017 and did not make him a millionare. I assume he just said that to generate attention for his company to get new customers. And in my opinion this is the worst you can do.
- But right behind this is the fact that most of these new "webflow agencies" do not know, what they are doing. 
- During my time in these discord servers I got pretty well into how these people are working on there projects. 
- You remember what I said about building a website? Those people do not search for a purpose for the customer. They only do what in there opinion fits best to the company. No real project management. Costs are only estimated by a short description of the project. No details on how long each page would take individually. Often they also do fixed prices like 2000€ per website. 
- They just use one of the default templates or buy one that costs about 50€ and modify them to look like it matches the astetic of the customer. Spoiler: in most cases it does not.
- Many of them also vendor-lock in to tools like webflow, which do not have that much plugin support and it is hard to add real custom behaviour to the website. 
- They never heard about about SEO and they buy the domain for their customer under their own name. Might look fine in the first place, but actually it can be pretty frustruating for the customer if they want to switch to another agency. 
- When it comes to legal stuff, this is what triggers me the most. Those people either use just simple GDPR notice generators or AI to generate their legal texts for them. No further checks if there are actually no external contents loaded before you perform any action in the consent banner.
- Being unprofessional and selling bad services. Okay, you are just a bad agency. But not caring about the legal compliance of your products by using AI is very very very unprofessional. If you do exactly that, you should not be allowed to ever build anything for a customer ever again. 

- But this was only about websites. When it comes to building custom applications it gets even worse. I will make it short. Most of the people I talked to have absolutely no experience. They wanted some python tutorials online and how think that a bachelors or masters degree is worthless, because they already know everything to build a functional application. Some of those people I talked to even never heard the word password hashing. They thought it has something to do with choosing secure passwords for different applications. 
- Those people build production applications that do run in different companies or organisations they built the software for. No knowledge about privacy restrictions or software architecture. If it gets complex, ChatGPT is their way to go. 
- Its actually pretty sad from the perspective of a professional developer.


## So what would I do better?

- Well I was thinking a lot lately about opening an own agency for websites which is also one of the reasons why I decided to write about this whole topic.
- First of all the most important thing would be to invest in an expert in privacy and legal stuff. This is not only very important for me, but also for my customers.
- After that I would actually talk with the customer about their needs and build a custom website for their needs. No templates, no cost estimations based on nothing.
- If you really want to be a great agency to work with, you need a lot of time to fulfill the customer needs. It's not just building the website. You also need to host and maintain it, which can take a lot of time. 
- And this is the big problem. You just can't build a website that is legally bullet proof and fulfills the customer needs by 100% if it only costs 2000€. The minimum amount of money needed would be 5000€ for small websites. 
- And this is the main reason why I am not currently an agency owner. I do not have the time to properly provide good services for my possible customers. I know how much time it would take to build a good website. Therefore, it would be more expensive than the competitors websites, who do not put as much effort into those website as it would be needed to get a good result for the customer. 
- And this is why most of these agencies are still profitable, they are the cheapest on the market.
- Sure, your local barber shop does not need a fancy website to be successful, but if his website looks like every other barber shops website, the site is actually useless, because it has no USP (unique selling point).

## What can we do to avoid those people?

- Well to be fair, not every one man agency offering you a 2000€ website is bad. There are also many good people out there, who know well what they are doing. 
- But to seperate the good from the bad agencies we need to do some things. 
- The first, very unrealistic approach would be to require some sort of certification in order to be allowed to build websites for other customers like it is already established for other products. 
- For example, cars need to pass many security and quality checks before they can be launched into the consumer market. The problem with building websites is that it is accessible to anyone. Everyone can watch a two hour YouTube tutorial and start playing with webflow or wordpress and click together a mediocre website. But the end result is not really what most professional people would define as quality. The end customer of a car can say from his limited perspective, if a car is good. He can say if it is fast enough for his needs. But without any knowledge in mechanical engineering he is not able to say whether the engine is well constructed and will last long, or not. And the same goes with websites. The design might look good, but in the end it does not fulfill the customer needs or is just not GDPR compliant. Without any professional background the customer will never be able to measure the actual quality of a website properly. 
- And this is where certifications come in. If every person building websites for customers needs to be certified by some sort of institution in order to get the allowance to build websites, this would regulate the market and ensure that all websites build for customers are actually meeting quality and privacy standards. 
- But this is hard to establish, because it would require political actions. 

- The second approach would be to create awareness for this topic in the population. People should know, that a 2000€ website most likely does not meet the standards that a modern website should have. 
- The market would regulate itself in this case. More people knowing about this would have the effect of less people buying those crappy websites. 

- Same for building custom applications

- But to be fair I am not an expert in neither of these fields, altough I am member of a political party and have the basic knowledge of how the markets works. In the end I am not able to 100% ensure that those ideas would actually have an effect on the situation itself. So feel free to leave your own ideas and opinions in the comments.


- Just be careful if you are on the customers site. If your customer integrates you into the process of creating the website it can be an indicator for good quality. But take also a closer look at how the agency calculates it's prices and talk precise about how they do their legal stuff (GDPR, etc.), how they plan to design the website and how the whole domain thing is handled. If the agency is transparent with that this is also a big green flag. And hey, even if the agency is using a privacy notice generator this can still be a good deal, if the agency offers you a cheaper price and actively communicates that the price is less expensive because of this. Just be aware of what you need. Templates might also be fine at some point. Transparent communication is key when working with the agency. If your agency communicates transparently from the first day on how their prices are built and why there service is so cheap or expensive, this can actually be a good deal. But as always it is safer to be more careful whan less careful.
